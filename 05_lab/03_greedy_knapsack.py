# It fails, because it is not an optimal algorithm. It selects items based on the highest value to weight ratio without considering the overall capacity, leading to suboptimal solutions. 
# The DP solution finds the optimal combination of items that maximizes the total value without exceeding the weight limit, which is not guaranteed by the greedy approach.
